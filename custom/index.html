                    Oscar Wilde (1854–1900) was an Irish playwright, novelist, poet, and one of the most influential
                    literary figures of the late Victorian era. Known for his sharp wit, elegant writing style, and
                    brilliant social commentary, Wilde became famous through works such as The Picture of Dorian Gray
                    and his society comedies including The Importance of Being Earnest. Beyond his literary
                    achievements, Wilde’s life was marked by both dazzling success and personal tragedy. Despite facing
                    imprisonment and social downfall, his works have endured, continuing to inspire readers with their
                    beauty, humor, and profound insight into human nature.

                    High above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince. He was gilded all over
                    with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on
                    his sword-hilt.<br>
                    He was very much admired indeed. “He is as beautiful as a weathercock,” remarked one of the Town
                    Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic tastes; “only not quite so useful,”
                    he added, fearing lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.<br>
                    “Why can't you be like the Happy Prince?” asked a sensible mother of her little boy who was crying
                    for the moon. “The Happy Prince never dreams of crying for anything.”<br>
                    “I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,” muttered a disappointed man as he
                    gazed at the wonderful statue.

                    “He looks just like an angel,” said the Charity Children as they came out of the cathedral in their
                    bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white pinafores.<br>
                    “How do you know?” said the Mathematical Master, “you have never seen one.”<br>
                    “Ah! but we have, in our dreams,” answered the children; and the Mathematical Master frowned and
                    looked very severe, for he did not approve of children dreaming.<br>
                    One night there flew over the city a little Swallow. His friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks
                    before, but he had stayed behind, for he was in love with the most beautiful Reed. He had met her
                    early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so
                    attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.<br>
                    “Shall I love you?” said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the Reed made him
                    a low bow. So he flew round and round her, touching the water with his wings, and making silver
                    ripples. This was his courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.

                <p>
                    “It is a ridiculous attachment,” twittered the other Swallows; “she has no money, and far too many
                    relations;” and indeed the river was quite full of Reeds. Then, when the autumn came they all flew
                    away.<br>
                    After they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love “She has no conversation,” he
                    said, “and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.” And
                    certainly, whenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys. “I admit that she is
                    domestic,” he continued, “but I love travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling
                    also.”<br>
                    “Will you come away with me?” he said finally to her; but the Reed shook her head, she was so
                    attached to her home.<br>
                    “You have been trifling with me,” he cried. “I am off to the Pyramids. Good-bye!” and he flew away.

                    All day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city. “Where shall I put up?” he said; “I
                    hope the town has made preparations.”<br>
                    Then he saw the statue on the tall column.<br>
                    “I will put up there,” he cried; “it is a fine position, with plenty of fresh air.” So he alighted
                    just between the feet of the Happy Prince.<br>
                    “I have a golden bedroom,” he said softlyto himself as he looked round, and he prepared to go to
                    sleep; but just as he was putting his head under his wing a large drop of water fell on him. “What a
                    curious thing!” he cried; “there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and
                    bright, and yet it is raining. The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful. The Reed used
                    to like the rain, but that was merely her selfishness.”

                    Then another drop fell.<br>
                    “What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?” he said; “I must look for a good
                    chimney-pot,” and he determined to fly away.<br>
                    But before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up, and saw — Ah! what did he
                    see?

                    The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running down his golden cheeks.
                    His face was so beautiful in the moonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity.<br>
                    “Who are you?” he said.<br>
                    “I am the Happy Prince.”<br>
                    “Why are you weeping then?” asked the Swallow; “you have quite drenched me.”
